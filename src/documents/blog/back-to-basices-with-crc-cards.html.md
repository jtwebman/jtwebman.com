Lately I have had really bad programming practices. I have been doing it professionally now for over 15 years but for the last 5 or so I seem to go straight to the code editor once I have a great idea or once I say yes to a project. I did learn the correct way to design software but since going agile the teams I have worked on and even while working on my own stuff I just go straight to writing code. Well sometimes we do a really small white board season on a complex part but no real design at all.

So first I wanted to figure out why. Did I think it was stopping me from be creative? Did I think it was more agile to build then refactor without design? Did I think I knew everything and could design it all in my head as I typed? Well I think it might have been a little of all three. Now I know I don't know everything, it took 35+ years to figure that out, but none of these are good reasons and are just false.

So once I figure that out my first instinct was to sit down and watch some videos again on basic object oriented programming practices.

I got a huge amount of gems from the video but the huge one though was just him walking through the 5 steps to doing design.

1. Gather **Requirements**
1. **Describe** the application
1. **Identify** the main objects
1. Describe the **interactions**
1. Create a **class diagram**

Now, I have been gathering requirements but most of the time they are in my head and never write them down. This is bad so to start from new now I decided to pick the project I have been working on for a couple months and start at the beginning and write down the requirements for it. I have been working with a friend [Emily](https://twitter.com/EmilyKolberg) on it so I hope she is ok with make this public.

For the next step I needed to describe the application so I went ahead and wrote up some user stories and some use cases for the app. It has been 5 plus years since I have written a correct use case but I would love your feed back on how well or bad I did so far.
