I have built many websites for customers and content seems to be the last thing they give me. So I tend to go over to [Lipsum](http://www.lipsum.com/) and generate some Lorem Ipsum text to fill the void until I get some content. If you don’t know what it is:

> “Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry’s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.” – lipsum.com

Now you don’t have to just go with the standard. I found these two sites today that have a funny twist on generating text.

The first is [Bacon Ipsum](http://baconipsum.com/) which is a lorem ipsum generator but use types and cuts of meat. I have to say it’s a great idea and funny.

The second one is [Veggie Ipsum](http://veggieipsum.com/) which was inspired by Bacon Ipsum for the vegans and vegetarians. It just generates text with a bunch of vegetable names.

Now these could actual come in handy. If you are building a site for a big macho guy then you should use the Bacon Ipsum site. If you are building it for a woman that you think is a vegetarian then use the Veggie Ipsum. In the end it will get replaced but it still can be funny watching the client read the text asking, “What is this?”
